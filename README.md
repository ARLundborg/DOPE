## Efficient adjustment for complex covariates
Reproduces the experiment from `Efficient adjustment for complex covariates:
Gaining efficiency with DOPE'.

[arXiv:2402.12980](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12980)

## Setup
To run the simulation study on synthetic data:
> python experiments/simulation_study/run_estimators.py

To run the coverage study on synthetic data:
> python experiments/simulation_study/run_coverage.py

The plots in the main manuscript are generated by running:
> python plot_coverage.py
> python plot_estimators.py


The NHANES datasets were loaded and cleaned using
> cd experiments/NHANES

> python clean_data.py

> python clean_data.py --impute_all

and the NHANES analysis was run with
> python analyze_nhanes.py --tune_hyperparameters

> python analyze_nhanes.py --use_imputed --tune_hyperparameters
